## üßπ Data Preparation Steps

1. **Null Value Handling:**
   - Replaced missing values in the `Gender` column with `"Unknown"`.

2. **Age Correction:**
   - Used `VLOOKUP` to resolve data quality issues by assigning a consistent age for each manager.

3. **Age Group Creation:**
   - Created a new `Age Group` column using the formula:
     ```
     =IF(I2<=35,"A1",IF(I2>35&I2<=45,"A2","A3"))
     ```

4. **Production Cost Per Unit:**
   - Added a column to calculate cost per unit:
     ```
     = Total Cost / Unit Price
     ```
